## ⚙️ Features

### 📊 Data Management
The data for books and users is provided in CSV format. The application reads the data from the CSV file and stores it in an ArrayList. 
The loan information is also stored in the ArrayList.

### 📚 Book Management
Users can view all the books available in the library, as well as search and sort the books by ID, title, author, genre, publisher, and loan counter. 
The loan counter indicates the number of times a book has been loaned.

<h3>🤵 User Management</h3>
Admins have access to a user management system where they can view all the users and their loan history, as well as search and sort the users by name or ID.

### 📝 Loan System
Customers can loan a book and view their currently loaned books. They cannot loan a book that is already out on loan. Admins can run a report that shows all books currently out on loan and the number of times each book has been loaned out.

### 📊 Reports
Admins can run a report that shows all books currently out on loan and the number of times each book has been loaned out. The report can be outputted in CSV format.
